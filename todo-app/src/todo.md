Things to do: deadline 14th Aug.

<WidgetIdeas>
- Analytics chart that shows number of tasks completed per day.
- create reminder widget for upcoming tasks. For the 4 most upcoming widgets.
  -> If the user happens to not use due dates, remove the widget entirely.
</WidgetIdeas>
<CurrentPlan>

**least importantant**
- An input element must have an autocomplete attribute. (later)
- gradient for the backgrounds of all pages. (half complete) (not sure on what type of gradient...)
- Theme button not as thick as other menu buttons.

- Fully rewrite the error and success components.

**mid importantance**
- Timer widget needs to be larger to fill out dashboard.

- Fully setup and review login for users.
- Logging out feature.
  -> Own modal component.

- Found bug for changing break and work modes button in the timer page.

**most importantant**
- testing for errors during signing up user.

- Add google for logins for UX.
- Find hosting options for application.
- Fix other less important bugs and ship the damn app.

- Optimistic updates on queryClient.
- error boundary component for important parts of application.

- Create verification component.
  -> function that refreshes the page and checks verification status
     again. (only solution to think of currently).
**most important end**

**Leave this for after the beta**
- Reorder feature on the main TasksPage.
  -> Requires another firebase reset for new structure.
  -> Same position style reordering and client side updates done with the subtasks before.
