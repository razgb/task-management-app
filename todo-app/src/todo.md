- TaskExpanded SubTask swap feature doesn't exist.

- Recent tasks to filter updatedAt fields and display 6 most recent tasks.

- Create reminder widget for upcoming tasks. For the 4 most upcoming widgets.
  -> If the user happens to not use due dates, remove the widget entirely.

- TaskProgress, RecentTasks, and UpcomingTasks need access to
  tasks data. Therefore create a custom hook with the useMutation
  that TasksPage already uses. ReactQuery will handle the rest.
