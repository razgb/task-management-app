12-07-2024: Don't think about beauty or features. Finish raw functionality first.

no order:

- Dashboard component: calendar, maybe shadcn? Challenge: make my own.
- seems to be a layout shift between page components.

1.  Create task viewer with edit button too.
2.  Setup task builder with a form and input elements.
3.  On saving, write to localStorage with permission modal.
4.  For now save all tasks to recents block.
