Things to do: deadline 14th Aug.

===== WIDGET IDEAS =====

fucking remove the workspace bullshit file i have no idea how it works.

- Habit tracker.

- Calendar view and being able to see posts that have been given a deadline. Expanded UI too.

- Analytics chart that shows number of tasks completed per day.

- create reminder widget for upcoming tasks. For the 4 most upcoming widgets.  
  -> If the user happens to not use due dates, remove the widget entirely.

===== APP wide ideas =====

- the phone design of the application.
- set up firebase for the application.
- flatten the architecture as much as possible with the collections.
