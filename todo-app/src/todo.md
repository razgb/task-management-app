**least importantant**

**mid importantance**
- Logging out feature.
  -> Own modal component.

- ToDoItem not being added on task expanded page refresh.

- create reminder widget for upcoming tasks. For the 4 most upcoming widgets.
  -> If the user happens to not use due dates, remove the widget entirely.

- TaskProgress, RecentTasks, and UpcomingTasks need access to
  tasks data. Therefore create a custom hook with the useMutation
  that TasksPage already uses. ReactQuery will handle the rest.


**most importantant**
- Creating an option to change the description of the to do task when expanded.

- Add google for logins for UX.
- Find hosting options for application.
- Fix other less important bugs and ship the damn app.

- error boundary component for important parts of application.

- Create verification component.
